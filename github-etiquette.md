File paths should be kept short and sensible
Funky characters and spaces in file names can cause trouble because of differences between Mac and Windows
Always pull before starting to work on projects before pushing (someone could have done work on it since I pulled it) -> other people's work could get lost!!Ã¨
Make descriptions understandable for others
