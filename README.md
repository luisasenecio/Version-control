# Version-control
Practicing version control for the coding club tutorial
This includes notes from the tutorial as I follow the steps
The README.md file usually contains a detailed report on the project that this repository is about: collaborators, links to websites & media, contact details, etc.

# Notes on gitignore
Some files should not be added to the online repo because they might be too large
Other files are very temporary and will soon become irrelevant when more changes are being made (word, excel, powerpoint, ".Rproj" & ".Rhist" files)
